# Main Concepts

A computer program is a text file that contains a sequence of commands for a computer. There are many programming languages. Each of them requires the programmer to follow specific rules when writing the program so that the computer understands how to execute it. You will study the Javascript language and its rules.

## Commands

All programs contain commands. With the help of commands, you can "talk" to your computer.

For example, console.log() is used to print messages to the console (press F12 and select the Console tab to see it â€“ there may arleady be a lot of messages ðŸ˜Š):

**Please note:** end your command with ```;``` â€” so the computer knows for sure that this is the end of the command.

## Comments

A comment is an explanatory text for a program. It is not executed by the computer but helps programmers understand a program's logic better.

Comments can be single-line or multi-line.

Single-line comments are indicated by two backslash characters ```//```. For example:

Multi-line comments start with ```/*``` and end with ```*/```. For example:

## Literals

All programs work with data, such as numbers or strings. Literal is a way to write some data in the program.

Number literals consist of digits, ```-``` and ```.``` characters and do not require quotes: ```42```, ```-5```, ```3.14```.

String literals are always written in quotes: ```'Misha'```, ```'Hello, world!'```.

## Variables

Variables are used to store data. Variables are used to store data. This is like a box with a name in which we can put something. Later we can take the stored data to use it in our program.

The assignment operator ```=``` is used to set a variable value.

JavaScript allows you to create variables using ```let``` and ```const``` keywords.

Let's consider examples:

**Please note:** the variable name should explain what data is stored in it. Typically it contains one or more words in English. The first word should start with a small letter and the rest with a capital letter. Numbers (inside the name) and ```_``` or ```$``` characters are also possible but rarely used.
